=============== About Me ===============
I'm a Sys Admin & SOC Analyst

I’m an India-based cybersecurity professional focused on defending systems, investigating threats, and building automation for faster response and stronger security.<br><br>With practical experience in system administration, alert investigation, malware analysis, and security labs, I’ve solved numerous real-world SOC and detection challenges on platforms like Let’sDefend — including documenting clean and repeatable solutions to complex attack scenarios.

Defense is not luck — it’s strategy, automation, and speed.

=============== Projects ===============
End-to-End SOC Investigation & Detection Engineering Lab

Status: Completed + In Progress Enhancements
Stack: VirtualBox, Windows VM, FLARE-VM, REMnux, Sysmon, ELK Stack (Docker), Sigma Rules, Wireshark, Python

Overview

Designed a real-world SOC investigation environment to analyze malware, extract IOCs, and build automated detection workflows using Sysmon logs and SIEM monitoring.
This project demonstrates the complete incident response lifecycle: Analyze → Detect → Visualize → Automate

Phase 1 — Malware Analysis & Threat Investigation

Goal: Understand malware behavior and identify Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)

What I Did
• Configured isolated malware analysis lab (Windows + FLARE-VM + REMnux)
• Performed static & dynamic analysis on ransomware and trojan samples
• Investigated persistence, registry changes, file operations & C2 communication
• Captured IOCs using system logs, Process Monitor & Wireshark
• Created a structured incident investigation report

Outcome
• Strong understanding of malware lifecycle & forensic evidence
• IOC dataset later used for detection rule engineering

🔗 Lab Connectivity & Environment Integration

Configured VirtualBox internal networking to forward Sysmon logs & artifacts from the analysis VM to the ELK host machine.
Enabled seamless end-to-end visibility from malware analysis → SIEM detection → automation pipeline.

Phase 2 — ELK-Based Detection & Monitoring Pipeline

Goal: Build SIEM visibility and convert malware behavior into real detections

What I Implemented
• Deployed ELK Stack using Docker on host machine
• Forwarded Sysmon logs from malware VM
• Built dashboards for correlation & event visualization
• Created Sigma-rule detections based on IOC patterns
• Designed Python automation for triage & IOC enrichment

Outcome
• Real-time detection of malicious activities
• Faster investigation through automated decision support

Phase 3 — In-Progress Enhancements

• Integrating OpenEDR for deeper telemetry
• Developing automated response actions
• Expanding Sigma rule library with new samples

Skills Demonstrated

✔ Malware Analysis & Threat Research
✔ SOC Investigation & Incident Response
✔ SIEM Engineering & Detection Development
✔ Python Automation
✔ Log Analysis & Packet Forensics
